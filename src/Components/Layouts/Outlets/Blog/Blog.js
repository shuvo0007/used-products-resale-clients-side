                  What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
                  application?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-400">
                  There are four main types of state you need to properly manage
                  in your React apps: <br />
                  1. Local state, <br />
                  2. Global state, <br />
                  3. Server state, <br />
                  4. URL state

                  How does prototypical inheritance work?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-400">
                  The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to
                  add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which
                  an object can inherit the properties and methods of another
                  object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the Prototype
                  of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

                  What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual
                  units or components of a software are tested. <br /> They
                  enable you to catch bugs early in the development process.
                  Automated unit tests help a great deal with regression
                  testing. They detect code smells in your codebase. For
                  example, if you're having a hard time writing unit tests for a
                  piece of code, it might be a sign that your function is too
                  complex.

                  React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Angular: <br /> Angular has a steep learning curve,
                  considering it is a complete solution, and mastering Angular
                  requires you to learn associated concepts like TypeScript and
                  MVC. Even though it takes time to learn Angular, the
                  investment pays dividends in terms of understanding how the
                  front end works. <br />
                  React: <br /> React offers a Getting Started guide that should
                  help one set up React in about an hour. The documentation is
                  thorough and complete, with solutions to common issues already
                  present on Stack Overflow. React is not a complete framework
                  and advanced features require the use of third-party
                  libraries. This makes the learning curve of the core framework
                  not so steep but depends on the path you take with additional
                  functionality. However, learning to use React does not
                  necessarily mean that you are using the best practices. <br />
                  Vue: <br /> Vue provides higher customizability and hence is
                  easier to learn than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an
                  overlap with Angular and React with respect to their
                  functionality like the use of components. Hence, the
                  transition to Vue from either of the two is an easy option.
                  However, simplicity and flexibility of Vue is a double-edged
                  sword — it allows poor code, making it difficult to debug and
                  test.
